 *
 * Starting from Stage 2, Any Pokemon not yet 'found' should have its name replaced with
 * asterisks. The number of asterisks to be printed should be equal to the 
 * number of characters in the pokemon's name. This is not necessary for stage 1
 *
 * The pokemon_id should be displayed with leading '0's such that all of
 * the numbers align.
 *
 * The number of digits to be displayed is 3. e.g. if only 1 pokemon exists on the Pokedex
 * with pokemon_id 1, the ID should still have leading zeroes added such that they are
 * 3 digits long (i.e #001). 
 *
 * You can assume that no pokemon with ID > 999 will be added to the pokedex. i.e. Always print
 * IDs with 3 digits.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * --> #001: Bulbasaur
 *     #004: **********
 *     #007: ********
 *     #000: Caterpie
 *     #003: Weedle
