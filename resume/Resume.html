	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
	I have over 20 years of experience designing and
	developing enterprise applications for the
	<strong>Z/OS</strong> and other application platforms.
	</p>
	<p>
	I extensively use the <abbr title="ComputerAidedSoftware Engineering">CASE</abbr> tool <strong>CA Gen</strong> to design and develop enterprise scale
	applications comprising <strong>CICS</strong> server/online transactions and batch applications using <strong>DB2</strong> as the DBMS.
	</p>
	<p>
	I also have significant experience designing and developing Z/OS applications
	using "native" mainframe languages and technologies such as <strong>COBOL, JCL, MQ, XML etc.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	My experience has been mostly developing applications for the following
	Australian Commonwealth goverment departments.

	<a href="ICS.html">The Integrated Cargo System (ICS)</a>
	is a email/web interfaced application for managing, profiling, calculating
	duty on cargo. It handles over 250,000 cargo reports and declartions.
	Its core consists of over 200 CICS transactions and batch applications that
	were developed using CA Gen. These system components together profile cargo and
	estimate duty on various imported goods. My role was to help design and develop
	the Import Permit sub-system and help enhance the performance of the cargo
 	profiling transactions.

	 	The Integrated Core Processing system is a consolidated "single accounting"
	 	system that replaces legacy applications handling all income estimation and
	 	taxation assessements. It consists of CICS transactions developed using
	 	COBOL and using DB2 as the database. My role was to work in a team using
	 	the AGILE devlivery methodology to implement changes to the system.
